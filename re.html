  <h1>Overall Reflection </h1>
  <p> My journey in Graphic & Web Design Studio tasks was very interesting and beneficial, and I'd like to break it down into three mine points: time management, challenges and tasks, and personal website.
    Tasks and personal website: This was a short-term design project, and everything was new to me, including starting to design and build websites from scratch.was the crucial and essential factor that was needed in such a long project. Fortunately, I learned and gained the patience I needed. I had a good idea of what I wanted to do and achieve. Besides, communication was another extremely significant factor. It was essential to communicate and discuss with the tutor and the course mates regularly, for the information of the tutor was the most useful advice in the process of my mine project.
     
     
    Challenges
    With the start of the main project, On the other hand, challenges started to appear. I started to face a lot of technical problems. On the other hand, the main problem is that five years ago I stopped designing websites and coding in general. I have a very good understanding when it comes to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I needed about one month to recover my memories. I felt good to start again with coding. I overcame my challenges by having extra time after each class to review the html coding. One challenge for me was to delete and redo all my worksheet files from week 1â€“week 6 before starting my website. It was a good idea because this way I revisited all the codes again.
     
    Time management:
    As it is considered one of the most important elements of the project, completing the required project and tasks on time increases your confidence. As I mentioned, this was a very short term with limited free time. I managed to create a full planned schedule for this project and the other tasks. It was very helpful to manage my free time in addition to saving a lot of time to work on other projects too.
     
     
    In conclusion, this project was one of the most important and enjoyable classes I needed this year. I would like to thank Ms. Mary Jackson and Mr. Tom Garne for the determined help that I got in this class. I'll see you in future projects and challenges.
