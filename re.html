  <h1>Overall Reflection </h1>
  <p>My journey in Graphic & Web Design Studio tasks was very interesting and helpful I would like to break down my journey in three mine points time management, challenges, Tasks and personal website
    Tasks and personal website: This was a short-term design project, and everything was fresh to me from starting to design and making website from scratch. Patience was the crucial and essential factor that was needed in such a long project in my view. Fortunately, I learned and gained the patience I had good idea of what I want to do and achieve. Besides, communication was another extremely significant factor. It was essential to communicate and discuss with the tutor and the course mates regularly, for the information of the tutor was the most useful advice in the process of my mine project.
    
    
    Challenges: 
    With the start of the main project Challenges started to appear, I started to face a lot of technical problems ,on the other hand  the main problem is that five years ago I stopped designing websites and coding general I have very good understand when it comes to HTML CSS and JavaScript  but I needed about one month to recovery my mummeries it felt good to start again with coding  I overcome my challenges by having extra time after each class to reaves the html coding . one challenge for me was to delete and redo all my worksheet files from week1-week6 before starting my website, it was a good idea by this way I revisit all the codes again.
    
    Time management:
    it is considered one of the most important elements of the project, completing the required project and tasks on time increases your confidence, as I mentioned this was a very short term with limited free time, I managed to create a full plane schedule for this project and the other tasks it was very helpful to manage my free time in addition to saving a lot of time to work on other projects too.    
    
    
    In conclusion, This project was one of the most importing and enjoyably class I needed this year I would like to thank Ms. Mary Jackson and Mr.Tom Garne  for the determines help that I got this class . see you in new projects and more Challenges.
